- Non-tagged articles whose position is know by Wikipedia are shown on a map.
When a marker is clicked, a popup shows a JOSM remote link through which the user can easily add the Wikipedia tag in OSM.
- (Contribution by Cristian Consonni) When the coordinates of a non-tagged article is not known by Wikipedia, nuts4nuts_infer.py tries to infer them from the content of the article. New JOSM remote links are added to the tables when these coordinates are found.
- The script collects the names of the mappers who added tags since the previous day and lists them in a table inside the "Info" div, along with the numbers of added tags added.
